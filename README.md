# TES_analytics
A suite of algorithms and analysis tools written in collaboration with Dr. Mateusz Plucinski for analyzing data generated from malaria therapeutic efficacy studies and classifying malaria infections into recrudescences and new infections. It includes:
* An implementation of the Bayesian algorithm written by Mateusz Plucinski, based on the research article available [here](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aac.00072-15). Separate implementations are available for length-polymorphic as well as amplicon sequencing data.
* A tool implementing the ["WHO algorithm" and the "2/3 algorithm"](https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/case-management/drug-efficacy-and-resistance/tools-for-monitoring-antimalarial-drug-efficacy) for binary classifications of recrudescence and new malaria infections in TES data
