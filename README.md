# TES_analytics
A suite of algorithms and analysis tools written in collaboration with Dr. Mateusz Plucinski for data generated from malaria therapeutic efficacy studies. It includes:
* An implementation of the Bayesian algorithm written by Mateusz Plucinski, based on the research article available [here](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aac.00072-15) and available for length-polymorphic as well as amplicon sequencing data.
* A tool implementing the WHO algorithm and the 2/3 algorithm for binary classifications of recrudescence and new malaria infections in TES data
